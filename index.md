<p class="lead">These instructions are for making a 10 litre batch of <abbr title="Brew In A Bag">BIAB</abbr> beer.</p>

1. Heat 12.5 litres of water to 71&deg;C in a metal stock pot.
1. Place mesh bag into the stock pot and add the grains [^grains], stirring as you go to ensure there are no clumps.
1. Measure the temperature of the liquid after adding the grains, it should be around 66&deg;C, if it's too hot then add some cold water, if it's too cold then add some boiling water [^temperature].
1. Mash for 60 minutes with the lid on, the temperature should stay around the 66&deg;C mark.
1. Remove the mesh bag containing the grain from the stock pot, leaving the sweet wort in the stock pot.
1. Bring the wort to the boil
1. Once boiling, add the bittering hops to the stock pot and set a timer for 60 minutes
1. 15 minutes before the end of the boil add the flavouring hops
1. 5 minutes before the end of the boil add the aroma hops
1. When the 60 minute boil is finished turn off the heat source and cool the stock pot down in a sink or bath of cold water.
1. When the wort has cooled to around 20&deg;C pour it through a large sieve into a fermentation bin, splashing it as you do so to aerate the wort ready for fermentation
1. Top up the liquid in the fermentor to 10L by pouring cold water through the sieve of hops.
1. Pitch the yeast into the fermentor, seal the lid and add an airlock
1. Leave for 10â€“14 days to ferment
1. Bottle the beer and leave for another 14 days
1. Enjoy your homebrew!

[^grains]: For this 10L batch you'll probably have around 3kg of grain.
[^temperature]: The mash works best when the liquid is between 62&deg;C and 69&deg;C, any higher and you'll extract unfermentable sugars which will result in a sweet, weak beer.
